# Tone Toggles
Tone Toggles is a generative tone sequencing tool that blends the creativity of the user and the unpredictability of computer-generated-randomness to produce unique musical creations with each use.

## How To Play
Click or tap on the gray bars (aka "Tone Toggles") to turn them on and off. You can also use your "home row" keys for a more keyboard-like experience.

Each tone toggle is set to the same 8-beat rhythm. Turning one on will cause them to play to a random selection of beats. You cannot control what beat they play on, but you can change their beat selection by turning them on and off.
