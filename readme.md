# Tone Toggles
Tone Toggles is a generative tone sequencing tool that blends the creativity of the user and the unpredictability of computer-generated-randomness to produce unique musical creations with each use.

## How To Play
Click or tap on the gray bars (aka "Tone Toggles") to turn them on and off. You can also use your "home row" keys for a more keyboard-like experience.

Each tone toggle is set to the same 8-beat rhythm. Turning one on will cause them to play to a random selection of beats. You cannot control what beat they play on, but you can change their beat selection by turning them on and off.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Each Tone Toggle is set to the same 8-beat rhythm. However, unlike most sequencers, the user has no control over what beats a Tone Toggle can play on.

Turning a Tone Toggle on causes it to play on a randomly-decided selection of beats. To change this selection, the user can simply turn the toggle off, and then back on again. The intent here is for the user to think less about the exact arrangement of notes, and enter into a more experimental mindset where they are more likely to find unexpectedly delightful rhythms and chords.

The notes in each key are the same relative to the root, and are a mixture of major and minor scales. This will hopefully allow some interesting playing techniques, where the user can either change the selection of notes, or keep the selection the same and jump around keys for a more song-like composition.
